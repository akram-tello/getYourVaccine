        Vaccines are one of the methods to control this pandemic. It is also one of the best ways to protect society from COVID-19. Since the emergence of COVID-19, various efforts have been made around the world to develop the COVID-19 vaccine.

The Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply (JKJAV), co-chaired by the Ministry of Health of Malaysia and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, was established to ensure access to the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, safely, perfectly and effectively for the country.

JKJAV also plays an important role as the Main Committee in planning, implementing and monitoring the entire National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme. The National COVID-19 Immunisation Programme is the largest immunisation programme implemented in the history of our country. Therefore, the Government through the Special Committee for Ensuring Access to COVID-19 Vaccine Supply (JKJAV) will implement a comprehensive government and society or Whole-of-Government and Whole-of-Society Approaches together with various Ministries and Government Agencies, State Governments, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO), private and community members to ensure the program achieves its targeted goals.
